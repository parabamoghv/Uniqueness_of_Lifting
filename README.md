# Uniqueness of Path Lifting

## Goal: 
Provide a formal proof of the uniqueness of path lifting over a covering space.

## The Statement: 

The written statement of the theorem and a sketch of the proof is at [Statement/statement.pdf](./Statement/statement.pdf). The lean4 code for the formal verification of the theorem is at [Uniqueness/Basic.lean](./Uniqueness/Basic.lean)


## Mathlib files used:
1. Mathlib.Topology.Covering

4. Mathlib.Topology.PartialHomeomorph
5. Mathlib.Topology.FiberBundle.Basic
7. Mathlib.SetTheory.Cardinal.Basic
8. Mathlib.Topology.LocallyConstant.Basic


## Result: 
The theorem is formally verified by Lean4. Written 4 helping theorems and one main theorem. A total of 370 lines of code.
